		<h2>About Me</h2>
		
		<p>
			My name is Keagan Whiston and I am an avid software developer.  My first class on software development was Alice back in 2012 and ever since I have become fond of solving problems by coding solutions.
			Currently I am working on developing worlds in VRChat as game development has always been an industry I have wanted to be in since grade school.  Outside of coding I enjoy playing guitar, roleplaying with
			dungeons and dragons, crafting props, writing hip hop lyrics and streaming video games on twitch.  I also attempt to go for daily walks, get fresh air and stay physically active and hydrated.

		<h2>Schooling</h2>
		<p>
			In 2018 I earned my first college diploma in Computer Systems Technology - Networking from St.Clair College.  The program was insightful on the creation and maintenance of computer networks as well
			as insights into software development and webdesign. It also gave experience in help desk, network administration, network security and Linux based operating systems.  In the final year of the 3
			year program, I was put onto a team to complete a capstone project.  The project entailed going to a business, running network diagnostics and offering the business potential ideas or fixes for any
			issues that were encountered.  
		</p>

		<p>
			In 2021 I earned my second college diploma in Mobile Applications Development from St.Clair College.  This program was much more indepth on software development and I gained experience in creating 
			mobile applications for Android and IOS devices.  Some other languages that I learned in the program were Java, PHP and C#.  In the last year of this 3 year program, I was again put
			onto a team to complete a capstone project.  This project was to create some software or application for a business such as an Android app or a website.
