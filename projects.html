		<h2>Game Dev projects - 2023</h2>

		<h2>Lasalle Police Department - 2021</h2>
		<p>In 2021, my group and I were tasked with communicating with the LaSalle Police Department and creating a more fluent and improved website for them
			to use.  The first thing we had to do was update the original site to be compliant with the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act.  
			This required us to go through the entire site and change anything that was unaccessable and unreadable for all users.  Afterwards, we were then tasked with creating a responsive and brand new
			website for the police department and after our 12 weeks of work it was completed and the Department is very happy with the result.

		<h2>Valiant TMS - 2018</h2>
		<p>In 2018, I was added to a group to perform a network diagnostic on Valiants network.  Through this capstone my team and I went to Valiant
			, talked to our key contact and began our investigation on how to improve their network.  It was about a 10 week project and after it was completed we
			were able to offer Valiant a long presentation, many deliverables and new information on how they can improve their network.
